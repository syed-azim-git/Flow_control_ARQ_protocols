# Flow control ARQ protocols and Routing Algorithms

Python simulations of three important flow control ARQ protocols used in Data Link Layer and Transport Layer of Communication network layers.
1. Stop and Wait ARQ protocol
2. Go-back-N ARQ protocol
3. Selective Repeat ARQ protocol

Simulation of Routing Algorithms used in communication networks in python
1. Distance Vector Routing Algorithm - Using Bellman-Ford Equation
2. Link State Routing Algrithm - Using Dijkstra's algorithm
